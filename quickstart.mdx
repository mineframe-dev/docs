## Liftoff - Init tool

We plan on developing a tool to remove the need to manually add boilerplate when making new projects. This tool is not yet ready and is not avaliable for use.

## Manual setup

### Step 2: Project structure

- `docker-compose.yml` Docker Compose file to be used with Docker Stack in production deployments
- `dev.sh` Quick utility to make spinning up dev server easier.

  ```shellscript dev.sh expandable
  #!/bin/bash
  
  cd mineframe/dev && docker compose up --build
  ```
- `mineframe/` Main directory for Mineframe related things. You should put stuff like your plugin source code outside of this.
  - `servers/(server name)` Configuration data for a server
    - `Dockerfile` Dockerfile for the specific server.

      ```shellscript expandable
      FROM ubuntu:22.04
      
      RUN apt-get update && \
          apt-get install -y wget openjdk-21-jdk && \
          rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
      
      WORKDIR /app
      COPY server/ .
      COPY entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh
      RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh
      
      ENV RAM=2G
      ENV PORT=25565
      
      ENTRYPOINT ["/app/entrypoint.sh"]
      ```
    - `entrypoint.sh`  Entrypoint for development server, copies data from server defenition at startup. (CODEBLOCK TODO)
    - `server/` Server config, more info at [Server Configuration](/servers/configuration).
  - `dev/` Utilities and data specifically meant for development servers
    - `Dockerfile` Dockerfile to be used for the devservers. Idea behind this is to not include server files in the image, and instead load those at startup from a volume. (subject to changes upon Mineframe docker images)

      ```shellscript expandable
      FROM ubuntu:22.04
      
      RUN apt-get update && \
          apt-get install -y wget rsync openjdk-21-jdk && \
          rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
      
      WORKDIR /app
      COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
      RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
      RUN ls /usr/local/bin
      
      ENV RAM=2G
      ENV PORT=25565
      
      ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
      ```
    - `docker-compose.yaml` Docker compose to spin up required servers and services for development. Span up using Docker compose, not Docker stack.

      ```yaml expandable
      services:
        gate:
          image: ghcr.io/minekube/gate:d3c6a57
          container_name: gate
          restart: unless-stopped
          networks:
            - dev
          volumes:
            - ./gate.yaml:/config.yml
          ports:
            - "26000:26000"
        lobby: # lobby used as example, change to the server you need.
          build:
            context: .
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
          networks:
            - dev
          volumes:
            - ../servers/lobby/server:/initial_app:ro # lobby used as example, change to the server you need.
            - ./.data/lobby:/persistent_app # lobby used as example, change to the server you need.
          ports:
            - "26001:26001"
          environment:
            - PORT=26001
      
      networks:
        dev:
      ```
    - `entrypoint.sh`  Entrypoint for development server, copies data from server defenition at startup. (CODEBLOCK TODO)
    - `gate.yaml` Gate configuration for development server

      ```yaml
      config:
        bind: 0.0.0.0:26000
        onlineMode: false
        servers:
          lobby: lobby:26001
        try:
          - lobby
        forceKeyAuthentication: false
      ```
