## Liftoff - Init tool

We plan on developing a tool to remove the need to manually add boilerplate when making new projects. This tool is not yet ready and is not avaliable for use.

## Manual setup

### Step 1: Prerequisites

You'll need the following things before getting started:

- Unix-like development enviroment (Linux, MacOS, WSL)
- Server(s) with Docker and Docker swarm installed
- A Git repository
- Basic knowledge in GNU utilities and Docker 

### Step 2: Project structure

- `docker-compose.yml` Docker Compose file to be used with Docker Stack in production deployments
- `dev.sh` Quick utility to make spinning up dev server easier.

  ```shellscript dev.sh expandable
  #!/bin/bash
  
  cd mineframe/dev && docker compose up --build
  ```
- `mineframe/` Main directory for Mineframe related things. You should put stuff like your plugin source code outside of this. 
  - `dev/` Utilities and data specifically meant for development servers

### Step 3: Go live
